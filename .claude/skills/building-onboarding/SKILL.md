# Building onboarding

Sibling of `building-settings-pages`, and it assumes that skill's rules for words. Read this one whole
before the first edit: most of it is traps, and every one of them shipped at least once.

**The shape.** A titled, closable, fixed-width window that steps through pages with one button at the
bottom right. First a **hero** page: the app icon, a headline with one word accented, two or three lines of
description, optional capsules. Then one **list** page per set of things the user has to grant or set up:
a header, one grey paragraph, rows, and the stepping button. Optional extra list or hero pages between.
Last a **final** hero page whose button finishes and closes.

| You are in | Do this |
|---|---|
| **SnappySnap** | The window exists. `Sources/SnappySnap/UI/OnboardingWindow.swift` (the controller and the four pages), `GrantRow.swift` (`GrantID`, `GrantItem`, `FocusReturnWatch`, `GrantRow`, `Metrics`), `GrantCatalog.swift` (the rows), `ControlActionHandler.swift`. `SystemAdapters/OnboardingState.swift` holds whether it has been finished. Change it there; this file is the contract it keeps, and `docs/functional.md` §1 and §14 are the rules it obeys. |
| **A new app** | Copy `reference/OnboardingWindow.swift`, `reference/GrantRow.swift` and `reference/ControlActionHandler.swift` as they are (all three parse alone, under Swift 6 strict concurrency), edit the places marked `EDIT`, and write the grant catalogue. |

## The one thing agents get wrong

A fresh agent, given this exact task and no skill, produced a window that was right about the level and
wrong about everything that made this window painful. It is worth knowing what it chose, because you will
be tempted by the same three things, and it justified all of them:

| It wrote | It said | Why it is wrong |
|---|---|---|
| Row titled `"Login Items"` | "deliberately mirrors the System Settings section name" | That is the **pane**. The switch is called *Background App Activity*, and the pane also holds *Open at Login*, where the app appears too. The user reads the row, opens the pane, and cannot tell which of the two to touch. |
| `if !CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess() { open(settingsURL) }` | "the app does not just show failure" | The return value is the state **at the moment of the call**, still not-granted while the prompt is on screen. So this opens the pane every single time: the user gets the dialog *and* System Settings, one over the other. |
| `didBecomeActive` instead of a timer | "to avoid needless work on every focus change" | An accessory app is not activated when the user closes System Settings. The notification never fires, the grant never appears, and the window never comes back. |

## The window

```swift
let w = NSWindow(contentRect: NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 540, height: 440),
                 styleMask: [.titled, .closable], backing: .buffered, defer: false)
w.title = <app name>; w.center(); w.isReleasedWhenClosed = false
w.contentView = NSView()
```

**That is the whole window.** Everything else that has ever been set on it was a bug:

| Never set | Why |
|---|---|
| `level = .floating` | Above **every** app, including the System Settings window and the administrator dialog the wizard's own buttons open. It covers its own instructions. |
| `collectionBehavior` | `.moveToActiveSpace` drags the window between Spaces and re-inserts it at the **back** of the new Space's window list, so a Space switch and back leaves it behind the user's terminal. `.fullScreenAuxiliary` lets it sit over a full-screen app. A normal window belongs to one Space and keeps its place in it. |
| `.miniaturizable` | An accessory app has no Dock icon to restore from. A miniaturised wizard is a lost wizard. |
| `.resizable` | The height is the page's, set by the code. |

**The app is activated once, when the window opens** (`NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)` beside
`showWindow`), and that is the only unconditional activation in the feature. It is in front because it is
the last window to open, and from then on it takes its turn.

## Who is in front

This is the hard part and it has four cases. Get them from the table, not from instinct.

| The moment | What the window does | Why |
|---|---|---|
| A grant button opens System Settings, or a system prompt's own button does | **Nothing.** Stay where you are. | The flow reports back immediately, while System Settings is still coming up. Activating here is what put the wizard on top of the pane it had just opened. |
| The app the button sent the user to **quits** | Come back to the front: activate and order front | macOS gives an ordinary app the front back here and **skips `LSUIElement` apps**. `GrantItem.mayOpen` + `FocusReturnWatch`. |
| A dialog of the app's own is answered (administrator password) | Come back to the front | `NSAppleScript` with administrator privileges is drawn by SecurityAgent and blocks the main thread; when it closes an accessory app is not reactivated. `GrantItem.returnsFocus`. |
| The app becomes active for any other reason | Order front **only if no other window of the app is up** | Otherwise the wizard lands on top of the Settings window the user just asked for. Order front; never `activate(ignoringOtherApps:)`. |

**`mayOpen` is set on every macOS grant, not only the ones whose button opens a pane.** A system permission
dialog carries its own button to System Settings, so any of these rows can be the reason the user ends up
there, and the window has to come back when they close it. Set it to the System Settings bundle id for
Accessibility, Screen Recording, Input Monitoring, Notifications and the login item alike. Leave it nil
only for a flow that stays inside the app (registering `SMAppService.mainApp`, writing a config file).

`othersNeedUsActive` is injected, never inferred from `NSApp.windows`, and it does two jobs: it gates that
last case, and on `windowWillClose` it decides whether to `NSApp.deactivate()` — an accessory app with no
window left is still the active application, which sends the user's keystrokes nowhere.

**There is no flag for the second case.** The only alternative is `setActivationPolicy(.regular)` while the
window is up, which gives the app a Dock icon and needs a main menu a menu-bar app has never had. Do not
reach for it without deciding that with the owner.

## Naming a grant

**A row's title is exactly what System Settings calls the switch, quoted from the system's own strings.**
Not the pane it lives in. Not the API. Not the name macOS used two releases ago. The user has to find it in
a list, so a name of the app's own is a dead end however well it reads.

Never write one from memory. Look it up, every time:

```bash
ls /System/Library/ExtensionKit/Extensions | grep -i -E 'login|privacy|security|desktop|notification'
F=/System/Library/ExtensionKit/Extensions/SecurityPrivacyExtension.appex/Contents/Resources/Localizable.loctable
plutil -extract en xml1 -o - "$F" | grep -i -A1 '<key>ACCESSIBILITY</key>'
plutil -extract fr xml1 -o - "$F" | grep -i -A1 '<key>ACCESSIBILITY</key>'
```

As of the macOS this Mac runs (Darwin 27.0.0), for an app that calls these APIs. **Every one of these was
re-read from the loctables, not remembered**, and two of them had moved:

| The app calls | The row is titled | French |
|---|---|---|
| `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` (prompt) | Device Control and Data Access | Contrôle de l'appareil et accès aux données |
| `SMAppService.mainApp.register()` | Open at Login | Ouvrir avec la session |
| `SMAppService.agent(...).register()` | Background App Activity | Activité des apps en arrière-plan |
| `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess` | Screen Recording | Enregistrement de l'écran |
| `IOHIDRequestAccess(kIOHIDRequestTypeListenEvent)` | Input Monitoring | Surveillance de l'entrée |
| `UNUserNotificationCenter.requestAuthorization` | Allow Notifications | Autoriser les notifications |
| a sudoers rule, a privileged helper, anything of the app's own | the app's own name for it | there is no system switch to match |

**The Accessibility row is the trap this table exists for.** Every document, every blog post and every
memory of macOS calls that grant *Accessibility*, and the pane has not been called that for two releases:
`SecurityPrivacyExtension`'s `ACCESSIBILITY` key and TCC's `NOTIFY_HEADER_kTCCServiceAccessibility` both
read **Device Control and Data Access**. A row titled "Accessibility" sends the user looking for a heading
that is not there. The app may go on calling the *permission* Accessibility everywhere else — SnappySnap's
Settings › System does — because that sentence describes the grant rather than naming a place to find.

**Three traps inside the lookup itself.**

1. A pane holds several switches. Login Items shows *Open at Login* **and** *Background App Activity*, and a
   bundled agent puts the app in both lists. Naming the row after the pane tells the user nothing.
2. A loctable keeps retired names. Privacy & Security still ships `SCREEN_CAPTURE` ("Screen Recording")
   **and** `SCREENANDAUDIOCAPTURE` ("Screen & System Audio Recording") because they are two separate grants.
   **The API the app calls decides which**, not a guess about which key the pane reads. Grepping the pane's
   binary for a bare key name settles nothing: `LISTEN_EVENT` does not appear that way either, and Input
   Monitoring is plainly a section of its own.
3. A switch that is not a grant has its own name and it drifts too. Desktop & Dock's edge-tiling switch is
   **"Drag windows to left or right edge of screen to tile"**, not "Drag windows to screen edges to tile",
   which is what this app quoted for a year. Quote the switch, in both languages, wherever a sentence names
   one — the Settings pages as well as the wizard.

**A row that stands for two switches** — macOS's tiling needs two turned off — carries a name of the app's
own and quotes **both** switches word for word in `why`. Naming it after the pane would be the first trap;
splitting it in two would put a 50-character title into a 320 pt label that does not wrap.

Every name goes in both languages, through the project's localization helper, with the OS's own punctuation
(macOS writes a curly apostrophe: `Contrôle de l'appareil`).

## Never ask for a permission on your own

**Every permission prompt the user ever sees comes from a click of theirs, and there is no exception.**
Not at launch. Not when a window opens. Not when a feature that needs the grant is switched on. Not "once,
to get it out of the way". A prompt the user did not ask for arrives with no explanation beside it, and a
refusal is remembered by macOS for good: an unprompted ask is how an app loses a grant permanently.

Three ways this rule gets broken, and only the first is obvious:

1. **Requesting at startup.** A line in the app's start-up path that calls a request API, often guarded by
   something like "only once onboarding is done". If the user reached the end of onboarding without granting
   that row, the grant is still `notDetermined`, and the next launch prompts them out of nowhere.
2. **Reading state with a request API.** A request API returns the current state, so it is tempting as the
   reader. It also prompts. Behind a 2 s poll that is a prompt every two seconds.
3. **Asking from a background job.** A timer, a scheduled check, a wake handler. SnappySnap's weekly update
   check used to call `requestAuthorization` before posting its notification, which put a permission dialog
   on screen on a Tuesday for no reason the user could see. It reads `notificationSettings()` now and posts
   only if allowed; the ask lives on the wizard's Allow button, where a click is behind it.

So each grant has **two** separate calls, and they are never the same one:

| Job | Use | Never |
|---|---|---|
| read, on every poll tick | `AXIsProcessTrusted()`, `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()`, `IOHIDCheckAccess(...)`, `notificationSettings()`, `SMAppService...status` | any `request`/`Request` call |
| ask, from a button only | `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions(prompt)`, `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()`, `IOHIDRequestAccess(...)`, `requestAuthorization(...)`, `register()` | anywhere but a control's action |

`GrantItem.granted` is a reader and nothing else. If the only API a framework offers to read a grant is one
that also asks, the row shows "unknown" and offers its button; it does not call it to find out.

## What a grant button does

**It asks macOS, and it does nothing else** — and a button is the only thing in the whole app that may ask.
The system dialog carries its own button to the right pane, so the app never opens a pane beside it, and
never instead of it once the grant has been refused.

```swift
action: { _, done in Permissions.promptForAccessibility(); done() }       // right
action: { _, done in if !request() { openSystemSettings() }; done() }     // the double-open bug
```

The one exception is a grant macOS offers **no dialog for**, where the pane *is* the flow. Login Items for a
bundled agent is one; a setting like macOS's own tiling is another, and the button says what it does:
"Open Desktop & Dock Settings".

Consequences to accept rather than work around:

- A request API's result is the state **now**, never the user's answer. Never branch on it.
- Once a grant is explicitly denied, macOS shows nothing and the call returns the denial, so the button does
  nothing visible. That is the cost of the rule. Do not "fix" it by relabelling the button to *Open
  Settings…* on a second press: that reintroduces the second path.
- Call these APIs on the main thread. They return at once; they do not block on the prompt.

Every flow calls `done` on the main thread, always, including when it could do nothing.

## Following the system, without blinking

Nothing tells an app that a grant was made in System Settings. So:

- **Poll every 2 s while the window is up**, started in `showWindow` and stopped in `windowWillClose`.
  `didBecomeKeyNotification` is kept as well, but it cannot be the only signal: a window that is already key
  never sees that edge, and an accessory app is often never activated at all.
- **A page is built on a change of step and at no other time.** A grant that moves redraws the one row it
  belongs to. Rebuilding the page empties the content view and the replacement only lands at the next layout
  pass, which reads as a blink and a reload — on every press and every tick. Comparing state first and
  rebuilding "only when something moved" does not help: the flicker is the rebuild.
- **A row owns its trailing control** and swaps that alone, after comparing what it shows with what it should
  show, so a tick that changes nothing touches no view.
- **The stepping button's title is set in place**, never by rebuilding the page for a word.

**The loading state.** While a flow runs the row keeps the button that started it, **disabled, with a small
spinner beside it** — not hidden, not replaced. The poll must leave a busy row alone, or the next tick takes
the spinner away underneath the user. A flow that reports more than once settles the row on the first only.

## The pages

Numbers live in `Metrics` in `reference/GrantRow.swift`. They were fitted by eye. Reproduce them; you cannot
see the window, so do not retune one because it reads better in a diff.

- **Hero**: icon 104, headline 26 bold centred with one word in the brand colour, body 14 secondary, text
  wraps at 440, capsules optional, insets 32/40/36/40, spacing 18 with 10 after the headline.
- **List**: header 22 bold, one grey paragraph at 13 wrapping at 460, rows 12 apart with a separator
  between, insets 28/40, 20 after the intro and 24 before the footer, list width the page less 80.
- **Row**: title 14 semibold, an orange `exclamationmark.triangle.fill` after it when required, why 12
  secondary wrapping at 320, trailing control at the trailing edge.
- **Heights**: hero 440, final 400, and a list page takes **the height its rows need** — 560 for five rows,
  440 for two. The stack lays its views out from the top, so a page taller than its content leaves the
  stepping button floating above a band of nothing. The window resizes around its **top-left** corner, so
  the title bar stays put and the page grows downward.
- The accent word is localized **separately** from the headline, so a translation accents its own word.
- The brand colour comes from the app icon. SnappySnap takes the red of the snake's eye,
  `srgb(0.890, 0.149, 0.165)`, which is the mark's one colour that is not a neutral.
- The stepping button is `keyEquivalent = "\r"`, reads **Continue** once the page's rule is met and **Skip**
  until then. The permissions page's rule is every **required** grant; an optional page's is any one row.

## Swift 6

The three reference files parse under strict concurrency. Three things it refuses that older code does not:

- **A mutable global as an associated-object key.** `&trampolineKey` is a write to shared mutable state
  whatever the callee does with it. Use `nonisolated(unsafe) let` holding one allocated byte: the address is
  the identity, and the byte is never read.
- **A nonisolated `deinit` on a `@MainActor` class**, when it touches a non-Sendable stored property such as
  a `Timer` or an observer token. Write `isolated deinit`, as `Screens` and `SpaceWatcher` do.
- **A `Notification` crossing into the main actor's region.** `userInfo` carries an `NSRunningApplication`.
  Read the bundle identifier out in the nonisolated block and send the `String?` across, not the notification.

## The footer, and where the slack goes

**This one shipped in three of these apps at once, and it is the worst failure the window has had**: the
stepping button drawn at the bottom right of a list page, looking perfectly normal, and unclickable for
ever. It started the moment a permission was granted.

```swift
let spacer = NSView()
spacer.setContentHuggingPriority(.defaultLow, for: .horizontal)
let footer = NSStackView(views: [spacer, primary])      // the bug
```

A bare `NSView` has no intrinsic size, so **nothing decides that footer's height**, and the enclosing
vertical stack hands it every point the page is not using. Granting a permission swaps a row's 26 pt button
for an 18 pt "Granted" label, the list shrinks by 36 pt, and the slack goes into the footer:

```
before the swap   footer bounds 460 x 24     button frame (381, 0,  79, 24)
after the swap    footer bounds 460 x 186    button frame (381, 81, 79, 24)
```

The button is still inside the footer, so **no constraint breaks and `AXFrame` keeps naming a plausible
rectangle**. `AXPress` on it works. Every other element of the page hit-tests correctly. It has simply
stopped being where the page put it, and a press on it does not land.

**What holds.** A footer is a plain `NSView` with the button pinned to its trailing edge **and to both its
top and bottom**, which fixes the footer's height to the button's. The slack is then given somewhere on
purpose, a view of its own between the list and the footer, with vertical hugging and compression resistance
at **priority 1**, so no control can ever take it. `reference/OnboardingWindow.swift` has it.

**The rule behind it: `Metrics` decides sizes, and a stack view left free to decide one will.** Anywhere a
vertical stack holds a control beside something that can grow or shrink, ask which view absorbs the
difference, and answer it in the code rather than leaving it to Auto Layout.

**How to see it.** A frame that names a rectangle and a hit test that finds nothing there is this class of
bug, and only a real hit test shows it: the project's Accessibility probe prints the front window's subtree
with every element's frame, and asks what a hit test actually finds at a point. The window logs it too: the
`onboarding` category at `--level debug` prints the stepping button's frame in window coordinates and, up the
chain, each superview's height and whether it still contains it. Keep both.

- [ ] **The walk that catches it**: on a list page, with the permission not yet granted, press the stepping
      button: it advances. Go back, grant the permission, and press it again **without closing the window**.
      It must advance on the first click. A button that does nothing here is this bug, whatever it looks like.

## Wiring it into the app

- A **fresh controller every time** it is shown, so the pages re-read every grant and start at page one.
- `applicationShouldHandleReopen` prefers the wizard over the Settings window while it is up: with no Dock
  icon, opening the bundle again is how the user fetches it back.
- The last page's button records that onboarding is done, then closes. A window closed **before** that keeps
  the flag false, so the wizard returns at the next launch. Decide that deliberately.
- That flag is **not a setting**: it is one fact about this Mac, with no control in the Settings window.
  SnappySnap keeps it in `SystemAdapters/OnboardingState.swift`, in the app's preference domain, so the
  uninstall takes it with everything else. Putting it on `Settings` would owe it a row on a page.
- `Settings > System` gets a "Show Onboarding Again" button, which is also what a reset opens.
- A grant catalogue is **one list, shared** with the Settings window (`GrantCatalog`). The onboarding's words
  are in the item; a Settings page words the same state its own way. One list means a flow fixed once is
  fixed in both places.
- The wizard is the first run's window and it **wins over the Settings window**: a launch never shows two.

## Verify

```sh
swiftc -parse -swift-version 6 .claude/skills/building-onboarding/reference/*.swift   # they parse alone
swift build                                                        # the truth; SourceKit is stale
swift test                                                         # count TWO summary lines
grep -rn 'level *=\|collectionBehavior' <onboarding sources>       # nothing but the comment saying why
grep -rn 'activate(ignoringOtherApps' <onboarding sources>         # only where the table above allows it
grep -rn 'promptFor\|requestAuthorization\|Request.*Access' Sources # every hit inside a button's action
```

Then walk it on hardware, because none of this has an automated test:

- [ ] The window opens in front. Click another app's window: it goes behind and **stays** there.
- [ ] Switch to another Space and back: still in front of what it was in front of.
- [ ] Press a grant button: **only** the system dialog, never System Settings alongside. Same on a second
      press after refusing once.
- [ ] Reach the last page having granted nothing, finish, then quit and launch again, twice: **no prompt
      appears by itself**, at launch or while the window sits open. Every prompt in the walk followed a click.
- [ ] Press a button that opens System Settings: the pane comes forward and **stays**. Grant it, leave the
      pane open: the row ticks over on its own within about 2 s, with the wizard still behind.
- [ ] Close the System Settings window: the wizard comes back in front of what it was in front of. Leave it
      open and click another app instead: the wizard does not move.
- [ ] No page rebuild: on every press and every tick, only one row's trailing control changes. The header
      and the other rows do not move.
- [ ] Every row's title matches a heading in the pane its button opens, word for word.
- [ ] Opening the bundle again brings the wizard forward, not Settings. With Settings also open, activating
      the app brings Settings forward, not the wizard.
- [ ] Closing the wizard gives the front back to whoever had it; keystrokes go to that app.

## Red flags

| You are about to | Instead |
|---|---|
| Raise the level, or set a collection behaviour, so the window is easier to find | Reachability is a different problem from z-order. Use `applicationShouldHandleReopen`, ordering front when alone, and the poll. |
| Open System Settings because a request API returned false | It returns the state now, not an answer. Ask, and stop. |
| Relabel a button to *Open Settings…* after a refusal | Same second path, one press later. |
| Name a row after the pane, the API, or what you remember macOS calling it | Quote the switch from the system's loctable, in both languages. It has probably moved. |
| Write "Accessibility" as a row title | macOS calls that grant *Device Control and Data Access* now. |
| Rebuild the page to show a grant that moved | Redraw that row's trailing control. |
| Drive the refresh from `didBecomeActive` alone | An accessory app is often never activated. Poll. |
| Hide the button while its flow runs | Disable it and put a spinner beside it, so nothing jumps. |
| Ask for a grant at launch, from a timer, or when a feature needing it is switched on | Only a click asks. Report the missing grant and offer the button. |
| Read a grant with the API that requests it | Preflight and check APIs read; request APIs ask. Behind the poll, the second prompts every tick. |
| Give every list page the same height | A list page is as tall as its rows need, or its button floats. |
| Put the stepping button in a stack with an invisible spacer | A plain view, the button pinned top, bottom and trailing, and the slack in a view of its own at priority 1. It is unclickable the moment a grant swaps a row's button for a label. |
| Leave it to Auto Layout to decide which view absorbs a page's slack | Decide it. A control handed the slack moves out from under the pointer while still drawing where it was. |
| Retune a spacing, a height or a font size | The owner fitted them in the running window. You cannot see it. |
