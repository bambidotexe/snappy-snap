// One grant, and the row that shows it. This file holds the three things the onboarding's permissions
// page is made of, and it is where every trap the window hit lives:
//
//   GrantItem          what a grant is: its words, how to read it, how to ask for it, and the two
//                      activation facts (returnsFocus, mayOpen) that decide who is in front afterwards
//   FocusReturnWatch   gives the front back when the app a grant button sent the user to quits
//   GrantRow           the row itself: built once, updated in place, with a loading state
//
// Portable: AppKit only, nothing app-specific. A NEW project copies this file, deletes this header, and
// edits GrantID. Strings here are plain literals; route every one through the project's own
// localization helper (SnappySnap: L("English key"), with an entry in both Localizable.strings).
// It parses under Swift 6 strict concurrency.
// (In SnappySnap the live copies are Sources/SnappySnap/UI/GrantRow.swift and GrantCatalog.swift.)
