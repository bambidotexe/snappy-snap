# The shippable build, in the order Apple's checks need: release build signed with the team's Developer ID →
# notarize the app → staple it → wrap it in the disk image → sign and notarize the image → staple that too →
# prove Gatekeeper accepts what came out. Prints the image's path and nothing else on stdout.
